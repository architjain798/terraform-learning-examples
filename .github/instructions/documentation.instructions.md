- Include cost considerations for AWS resources

## Formatting Standards

- Use proper markdown formatting with headers
- Include code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Use emoji sparingly for visual organization (üìÅ, ‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Create tables for structured information
- Add line breaks for readability

## Cross-References

- Link to related examples in the repository
